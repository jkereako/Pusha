# Pusher
This is a small example of how to incorporate Pusher into a Swift project. There
is a small wrapper around the Pusher interface called PusherClient.

# Environment Variables
The Pusher API key is passed in with Xcode environment variables. I wrote some
code to help load environment variables.
